# Module Eight Journal.

* Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room, currently owns an Android exclusive application, "Draw it or Lose it." They are currently interesting in developing a web-based version of this game to serve multiple platforms and expand their userbase. 

* What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I feel as thought my general perspetice throughout the entire project was well maintained. I also like to think my recommendations for the client's needs were well made. 

* What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Honestly, I feel like it really laid it out for me in a way that really helped my mind process everything. It's like the programming equivelant of drawing one of those "Brain-storming webs" we used to do during priamry schooling. 

* If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

In hindsight, I'd probably definitely revise some of my recommendations- as far as security goes. When making them I feel like I was tunnel-visioning a bit on the good sides of cloud-based platforms and didn't really consider the disadvantages. I'm not sure I'd recommend against cloud servers all together but I definitely think I'd recommend keeping a local database at least for more delicate information such as user information. 

* How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I guess I just tried my best to meet them? Of course, whereever feasiable or smart to do. It's important in general to consider the user's needs because frankly, they're paying for a product to do what they need/want it to do. Imagine you hired someone to build a fence and instead they dig a moat around your house. 

* How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached the design of softawre process with an implimentation plan, allowing me to step through each portion of the project and address any developmental concerns as they appeared. This is a more waterfall-style approach rather than an agile but I think in the case of applications like this, it's effective enough.
